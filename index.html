            I am 25 years old and currently work in the financial industry. I have always been interested in computers
            and particulary coding, however, I never really pursued it, as I always had this image of it being
            extremely difficult and complex. After some researching on my own, I found that while it is certainly
            difficult, it is not impossible to learn. <br><br>I have particular interest in cyber security and game
            development. I would love to get involved in either of those to categories, although I am aware of how
            difficult and complex those two are especially.
